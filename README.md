# CORS-Anything-Goes

This is a very simple example that can be used to test CORS.

It will accept **GET, POST & OPTIONS** Requests.

It's written in PHP, just because it is simple to use

If you are not familiar with PHP, *no worries*, it's easy to run.

In the directory the file is located just run

```
sudo php -S localhost:3000
```

PHP will default to the index.php file, so if you just browse
to localhost, it will find this file.

Happy CORS
